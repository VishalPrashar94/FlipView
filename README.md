# FlipView
flipview implemented on coin

1. We picked flipview animation, it basically flips the side of a coin
2. there is a button on bottom, as u click it, it changes the side of the coin. However the button remains same.
3. Steps to make it work -------
  a. first i started a new project.
  b. I downloaded front and back images of coin.
  c. copied those images in drawable folder.
  d. used imageview to display the images.
  e. added a button named flip to flip the image.
  f. then come to main method, initialize imagesview and button that we used in layout and assign them those using their id's
  g. make a flipview method, in which we used fading animation.
  h. we used fadeIn and fadeOut functions for both the images.
  i. for the interpolator, we used accelerate and decelerate funtions.
  j. we used duration and fillAfter functions in both fadeIn and fadeOut.
